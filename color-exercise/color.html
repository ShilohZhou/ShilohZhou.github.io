	<h2>Additive</h2>
		<p>Additive color is color created by mixing a number of different light colors, with Red, green, and blue being the primary     colors normally used in additive color system.</p>
    
	<h2>Subtractive</h2>
		<p>A subtractive color model explains the mixing of a limited set of dyes, inks, paint pigments or natural colorants to create a wider range of colors, each the result of partially or completely subtracting (that is, absorbing) some wavelengths of light and not others. The color that a surface displays depends on which parts of the visible spectrum are not absorbed and       therefore remain visible.</p>

	<h2>Theory of Color</h2>
		
    
	<h3>Primary</h3>
   		<p>Primary colors are sets of colors that can be combined to make a useful range of colors. For human applications, three primary colors are typically used, since human color vision is usually trichromatic. For additive combination of colors, as in overlapping projected lights or in electronic visual displays, the primary colors normally used are red, green, and blue. For a subtractive combination of colors, as in mixing of pigments or dyes for printing, the colors magenta, yellow, and cyan are normally used. However, red, yellow, and blue are commonly used as primaries when painting or drawing.</p>
    
	<h3>Secondary</h3>
    	<p>For the human eye, the best primary colors of light are red, green, and blue. Combining the wavelengths of light we see as these colors produces the greatest range of visible color. Pigments, such as inks and paint, display color by absorbing some  wavelengths of light and reflecting the remainder. When pigments are combined, they absorb the combination of their colors,       and reflect less. Thus, combining pigments results in a darker color. This is called subtractive color-mixing, as mixing      pigments subtracts wavelengths from the light that is reflected.</p>
    
	<h3>Tertiary</h3>
		<p>A tertiary color or quaternary color is a made by mixing either one color with one, or two secondary colors, in a given such as RGB and CMYK (more modern) or RYB (traditional). Tertiary colors are a combination of full saturation of one primary       color plus half saturation of another primary color and none of a third primary color. Tertiary colors have specific names,       one set of names for the RGB color wheel and a different set of names and colors for the RYB color wheel. These names are       shown below. Brown and grey colors can be made by mixing complementary colors.</p>

	<h2>Color Models</h2>
		<p>A color model is an abstract mathematical model describing the way colors can be represented as tuples of numbers, typically as three or four values or color components. When this model is associated with a precise description of how the components are to be interpreted (viewing conditions, etc.), the resulting set of colors is called color space. This section describes ways in which human color vision can be modeled.</p>
        
        
	<h3>Analogous</h3>
		<p>Analogous colors are groups of three colors that are next to each other on the color wheel, with one being the dominant color, which tends to be a primary or secondary color, and a tertiary. Red, orange, and red-violet are examples.</p>
    
    
	<h3>Monochromatic</h3>
		<p>Monochromatic colors are all the colors (tints, tones, and shades) of a single hue. Monochromatic color schemes are derived from a single base hue and extended using its shades, tones and tints. Tints are achieved by adding white and shades and tones are achieved by adding a darker color, gray or black. Monochromatic color schemes provide opportunities in art and visual communications design as they allow for a greater range of contrasting tones that can be used to attract attention, create focus and support legibility. The use of a monochromatic color provides a strong sense of visual cohesion and can help support communication objectives through the use of connotative color. The relative absence of hue contrast can be offset by variations in tone and the addition of texture. Monochromatic in science means consisting of a single wavelength of light or other radiation (lasers, for example, usually produce monochromatic light), or having or appearing to have only one color (in compare to polychromatic). That means according to science the true monochromatic images can be strictly created only of shades of one color fading to black. However, monochromatic has also another meaning near to the words “boring” or “colorless” which sometimes leads to creating a design composed from true monochromatic color shades (one hue fading to black), and the colors created from the one hue but faded to all wavelengths (to white). This design should not be called as monochromatic in strictly scientific meaning.</p>
    
    
	<h3>Triadic</h3>
		<p>The triadic color scheme uses three colors equally spaced around the color wheel. The easiest way to place them on the wheel is by using a triangle of equal sides. Triadic color schemes tend to be quite vibrant, even when using pale or unsaturated versions of hues, offers a higher degree of contrast while at the same time retains the color harmony. This scheme is very popular among artists because it offers strong visual contrast while retaining balance, and color richness. The triadic scheme is not as contrasting as the complementary scheme, but it is easier to accomplish balance and harmony with these colors.</p>
    
    
	<h3>Complementary</h3>
		<p>Complementary colors are pairs of colors which, when combined, cancel each other out. This means that when combined, they produce a grey-scale color like white or black. When placed next to each other, they create the strongest contrast for those particular two colors. Due to this striking color clash, the term opposite colors is often considered more appropriate than "complementary colors".</p>
